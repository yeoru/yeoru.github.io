        If the existing music was played in the form of accidental performance in the real space, this work digitally constructs a virtual world that does not exist and is played through the accidental movement of the user.Prior to performing accidental music, 12 sound sources were deployed to transform the graphic scores to 3D. And the deformed 3D stereo music is actually input in the Unity program that creates the virtual. The sound source is placed within each object in the sheet music in Unity and consists of an algorithm that is linked to the audience’s position value. The sound that the audience touches in virtual reality directly through the body is output in real time to the 5.1ch and bone conduction earphones. The centerpiece of the work also functions as mute. The audience moves diligently to adjust the sound they want, and the sound is felt all over the body and the music is enjoyed.
